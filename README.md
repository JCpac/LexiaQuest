# LexiaQuest
A game made for a Bachelor's final project focused on dyslexic children.

This game was made as a proof-of-concept as a tool to help dyslexic portuguese children learn english.
Therefore, the general UI was created in portuguese, while the quizzes were made in english.

There are many aspects of the game that were designed to make the game easy to be used by dyslexic children,
such as the UI font, the platforming and quiz designs, the positive reinforcement in quizzes, amongst others...

## Development
This game was made in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (v3.4.stable.official [206ba70f4]), a free and open-source game engine.
Some of its assets were taken for free from the [Godot Marketplace](https://godotmarketplace.com/), while others were made by the developers.

Yes, "developers"; plural. Initially, this game was just a single-level platforming game made for another class of the same Bachelor.
The original game was made in conjunction with [my colleague](https://github.com/fmls99).

## The Game
Lexia Quest is a platforming game, with some simple quizzes written in and about the english language.
It contains 3 levels of increasing platforming difficulty, along with 4 different types of quizzes.
The first 2 levels have 1 type of quiz each, while the other 2 types are contained in the 3rd level and picked randomly.

The player is capable of jumping from the ground and from a wall.
They are also capable of interacting with the tutorial signs that exist in the 1st level, in order to learn the mechanics of the game.

The objective of each level is to open and collect presents scattered throught the map.
Each present opens a quiz that must be solved in order to collect the present.
Once 3 presents are collected, the level may be ended by reaching the signboard on the right-most side of the map,
although each level has 5 presents, should the player want to get a higher score.

The player's character is controlled with the keyboard, while the quizzes and menus are controlled with the mouse.
This change in controls disturbs the overall flow of the game, but on-screen character controls had to be scraped, due to a lack of time.
It was left as potential future work, should this project be expanded upon by another student.
