Let 64 pixels be 1 unit.
Each large dirt block has dimensions (1, 1).
Each small dirt block and each crate have dimensions (0.5, 0.5).

Player abilities:
	- Floor jump:
		- height clearance of 1 (almost 1.5, but not quite)
		- (2.5, 0)
		- (2, 1)
		- (3, -1)
		- (3.5, -2), but it's too close, it's best to use (3, -2) in-game
		- (3.5, -3)
		
	- Wall-jump:
		- distance of 2 between walls
		
	- Climbing a wall (both 2-wall wall-jumps and same-wall wall-jumps):
		- ceiling with 1 as the minimum height (0.5 is too annoying, especially for same-wall wall-jumps)
		
Platforming challenges:
	- Jumping over a pit:
		- Easy:
			- (2, 0)
			- (1.5, 1)
			
		- Medium:
